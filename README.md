# COSC 415: Pull request exercise

This repo exists for getting (optional) practice with a pull request.

## Section A: if working from the shell

 1. Clone this repo to your own computer 

 2. Create a new branch, using your first initial and last name, e.g., jsommers

 3. Change to that new branch

 4. Edit this README.md file, under the section below labeled Your edits. Add a couple lines of text to introduce yourself and to say what you did over the summer.

 5. Commit the changes to your local repo (make sure the changes go to your branch, not to the main branch)

 6. Do a git push origin BRANCH, where BRANCH is replaced with your branch name.

 7. Go on to github.com in this repo, and create a pull request for your branch. You're done.

## Section B: if working straight on Github

 1. Click on the "edit file" icon on this page

 2. Edit this file, under the second below labeled Your edits. Add a couple lines of text to introduce yourself and to say what you did over the summer.

 3. At the bottom of the page, click on "Create new branch". Name the branch using your first initial and last name, e.g., jsommers.

 4. Add a commit message (don't just leave it as "Update README.md").

 5. Make sure that a new pull request has been started using the new branch that you've created. If that's the case, you're done.


**Note**: these are _not_ the only ways to create a pull request. For a repo on which you aren't an owner, you would clone the repo on github, edit your clone, then create a pull request between your clone and the original repo. The patterns above are more useful when you're working in a team and performing internal code reviews of team members' edits.
